## About Me
I am Research Scientist at the [Center for Science of Science and Innovation](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/science-of-science.aspx) working for [Dashun Wang](https://www.dashunwang.com/) at the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University. As a Research Scientist, he oversees the lab's overall AI efforts, data analytics, and data management. He works closely with other team members to ensure these initiatives align with the lab's goals and contribute to its broader research objectives. My research interests lie in the intersection of Large Language models, Science of Science, Representational Learning, and Uncertainty Quantification.

Previously, I was a Ph.D student advised by [Dr. Hamed Alhoori](https://alhoori.github.io/), and my dissertation fully funded by the [NSF grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2022443&HistoricalAwards=false). focussed on building a predictive modeling framework to investigate the [*Reproducibility crisis in AI*](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.359.6377.725?casa_token=B4RgaLsweT0AAAAA%3AsuAiGo_9E7o0T0WkRQPxEQVn3-X9edRZ8OatwAxM2YEifI-S2bGXYNtTwNdRDg38zqEVTqBhLYe1SfE). Previously, I was a [Givens Research Associate](https://www.anl.gov/education/givens-associates) and an [Argonne Leadership Computing Facility Graduate Student researcher](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/alcf-student-opportunities).

My most recent project involves using [symbolic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_programming#:~:text=In%20computer%20programming%2C%20symbolic%20programming,if%20they%20were%20plain%20data.) to build Neural Architecture Search pipelines for Graph Neural Networks.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on fine-tuning large language models, implementing LLM agents, LLM's + Graphs.
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring **Ways bring GraphRAG to the larger scholarly ecosystem, and Science of Science data**
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **Building microservices for LLMs; Agentic LLM tooling as a service layer**
- 🤔 I’m always looking for help with **Building Knowledge Graphs within Citation Networks**
- 💬 Ask me about Large Language models, Graph Learning, Uncertainty Quantification, Neural Architecture Search.
- 📫 How to reach me: [@akhilpandey95](https://x.com/akhilpandey95)
- 😄 Pronouns: (he/him)
- ⚡ Fun fact: **Haskell** has *type inference*, meaning it can automatically determine the type of a data by looking at how it is created.
