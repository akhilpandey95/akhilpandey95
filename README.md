## About Me
I am an Applied Research Scientist at the [AllSci Corp](https://allsci.com/) working on AI4Science objectives. My research interests lie in the intersection of Large Language models, Representational Learning, Information Theory, Science of Science, and Uncertainty Quantification. In the past, I was a research scientist at the [Center for Science of Science and Innovation](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/science-of-science.aspx) working for [Dashun Wang](https://www.dashunwang.com/) at the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University.

Previously, I was a Ph.D student advised by [Dr. Hamed Alhoori](https://alhoori.github.io/), and my dissertation fully funded by the [NSF grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2022443&HistoricalAwards=false). focussed on building a predictive modeling framework to investigate the [*Reproducibility crisis in AI*](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.359.6377.725?casa_token=B4RgaLsweT0AAAAA%3AsuAiGo_9E7o0T0WkRQPxEQVn3-X9edRZ8OatwAxM2YEifI-S2bGXYNtTwNdRDg38zqEVTqBhLYe1SfE). Previously, I was a [Givens Research Associate](https://www.anl.gov/education/givens-associates) and an [Argonne Leadership Computing Facility Graduate Student researcher](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/alcf-student-opportunities).

My most recent projects include training reasoning models and doing tests on scaling hypothesis for test time compute for scientific text generation. Specifically, finetuning and performance tuning DPO, ORPO, and recently GRPO on different open weight models. More can be found [here](https://github.com/akhilpandey95/s1). Additionally, I'm interested in conducting research investigating the topic of credit assignment problem for qualitative texts in science (peer-reviews). More specifically, if there exists a scientific task, *Creating reward signals for LLM reasoning beyond math/programming domains* is **hard** is a well agreed upon notion. More about this can be found in project [LMRSD](https://github.com/akhilpandey95/LMRSD).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on fine-tuning large language models, implementing scientific LLM agents, exploring the utility of LLM's + Graphs.
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring **Ways to improve agentic PeerReview for the larger scholarly ecosystem, and scientific publications**.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **Building microservices for LLMs; Agentic LLM tooling as a service layer**
- 🤔 I’m always looking for help with **Building Knowledge Graphs within Citation Networks**
- 💬 Ask me about Large Language models, Representational Learning, Information theory, Graphs, Uncertainty Quantification, Neural Architecture Search.

- ⚡ Fun fact: **Haskell** has *type inference*, meaning it can automatically determine the type of a data by looking at how it is created.
